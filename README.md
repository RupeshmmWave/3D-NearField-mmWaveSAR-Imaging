# 3D-NearField-mmWaveSAR-Imaging

3D Nearfield mmWave imaging of a remote object using SAR method over K-band frequency. 3D Nearfield SAR CST model is created for data collection (signal reflection). Further these data are used for image reconstruction. 
Rawdata: Collected from CST MW Studio 
Code: MATLAB

File: mmWaveSAR_3DImage.m is used for mmWave image reconstruction Rawdata: Data_3D_18GHz.mat
